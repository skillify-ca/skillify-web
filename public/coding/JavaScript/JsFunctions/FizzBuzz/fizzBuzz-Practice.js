/*
  
  * In this challenge you will be writing a function for the classic coding problem, "FizzBuzz"
    * You will need to return the word "Fizz", if the given value is divisible by 3 and "Buzz" if it is divisible by 5
    * If the value given is divisible by both 3 and 5, return the word "FizzBuzz"
    * You may assume that the given value must be divisible by 3,5 or both

  

  * Hints / Tips:
    
    * The modulo (%) operator returns the remainder of integer division. 
      * "8.32 % 1" returns the decimal remainder .32
    
    * Conditional statements (if , else if, else) are helpful when needing to see if a specific criteria is met
