/*
  
  * In this challenge you will be writing a function for to find the winner of a basketball game !
    * In basketball, there are 3 pointers and 2 pointers and in this game, their are 2 teams, the Raptors and the Warriors
    * A 3 pointer is worth 3 points and a 2 pointer is worth 2.
    * You will be given the number of 3 pointers and 2 pointers for the Raptors and Warriors and your job is to determine the winner
    * Your final answer must be in this format : "The final score is 56 to 64, therefore the Warriors are the winner !"
    * When returning the final score, state the Raptors first, then Warriors.
    * You may assume their will be a winner, hence a tie is impossible.

  

  * Hints / Tips:
    
    * The use of variables may be useful when finding out the total number of points for each time 
      * "8.32 % 1" returns the decimal remainder .32
    
    * Conditional statements (if , else if, else) are helpful when needing to see if a specific criteria is met
