   * In this challenge you will be calculating how much home equity you own from the given parameters:
   * the total value of the home, the down payment in dollars, mortgage period, and the number of months after home purchase.
   * Consider using this formula, Equity = (downPayment + (number of months after home purchase * Monthly Mortgage Payments))
   * Note: since we are dealing with outputting money, to output to 2 decimal places do .toFixed(2)
