          This was a fantastic book to read. The author creates a complicated
          world with well-developed characters, weaves the plot back and forth
          between character groups (even various time periods with the same
          people), and never loses sight of the broader storey. This is a
          regular occurrence in fantasy literature, and I frequently lose
          interest in one set of characters while waiting for the plot to return
          to the group that has my attention. This is not the case with this
          book. Sanderson keeps each plot original and fresh. It's tough to be
          innovative in a genre when there have been so many masters, yet this
          author has succeeded.He does an excellent job of transitioning between
          different parts of the storey. When authors shift from one time period
          to the next (or one set of characters to the next) in the development
          of sub plots, for example, I sometimes forget specifics or have to go
          back and examine previous storey arcs. Sanderson knits numerous
          storylines together flawlessly, so this isn't essential. Even
          storyline aspects that appear impromptu or unconnected become crucial
          to the broader storey as the work proceeds. As the novel nears its
          conclusion, it appears to be picking up speed.I can't help but believe
          that the author's completion of the Wheel of Time series provided him
          with valuable knowledge into structuring and writing an extensive and
          well-constructed fantasy universe like this. He was already gifted,
          and he was given the opportunity to look under the hood of a master
          during a crucial moment of his authorship. Overall, I give this book a
          4.9/5 as it has quickly risen to one of my favourite fantasy books.

          What qualities do we search for in a sequel? Personally, I'd like to
          see character and plot development. I'm hoping for more world-building
          and solutions to the problems that were addressed in the first book.
          Words of Radiance is the second instalment in the ambitious Stormlight
          Archives series, and it succeeds on all of these fronts, as I can
          confirm.Sanderson, once again, does an excellent job of weaving his
          magic system throughout the novel without creating info-dump passages.
          However, his world-building does not stop with the magic system; this
          time, we also learn about the Parshendi race and culture. I found the
          interludes in The Way of Kings to be jarring and often tedious, but —
          once again, I'm forced to eat my words! — the interludes in this book
          were far more significant. The inclusion of a point of view from
          Eshonai, a Parshendi warrior/general, provided us with
          much-anticipated information about their species. The Parshendi, you
          see, communicate through song and have various forms that can change
          depending on their needs. Throughout the novel, they begin to plan and
          adapting physically and mentally for war. The build up to this was
          downright thrilling and made for one explosive conclusion. I give this
          book a 5/5.
