            <h2>What is Carnitas?</h2>
            <h4>Carnitas needs no introduction. Its very succulent and juicy
                pork thats been slow braised and confited in its own fat along
                with spices, then pulled apart and crisped to perfection. Lets say
                its simply the best taco filling.

            <h1>How to make carnitas:</h1>
            ​
            <h4>Making these carnitas are super easy, barely an inconvenience.
                All you need is an instant pot and follow these steps:
            </h4>
            <ol>
                <li><b>Brown the pork.</b> Chop up your pork and season them well with salt and pepper.
                Next you pre-heat your instant pot on the saute high setting, with enough oil to
            cover the bottom of my instant pot. Sear the pork cubes on 2-6 sides for 1-2 minutes per side.
            Long tongs and a splatter shield is highly recommended here.</li>
            ​
            ​
            <li><b>Add your braising liquid.</b> For the instant pot you'd ideally have about 1" less liquid
            than the top of the pork cubes. More on the braise in the ingredients section below</li>
            <li><b>Cook at pressure.</b> Close the lid of the instant pot. You may need to open the release 
            valve to get it to close as it may still be hot the browning step. Cook at high pressure for 45 minutes,
            then quick release.</li>
            <li><b>Shred and crisp.</b> This is an important step that you shouldn't skip. Using two forks, Shred
            the cubes of pork completely. Transfer to a cast iron skillet or other pan. Working in batches, form a thin layer
            of meat about 1/2" thick and crisp for 4-5 minutes on medium heat. Once done, add about 1/2 cup of the braising liquid
            in. Mix it up, and you're done. Enjoy on tacos, in burritos, or any other way you'd like.</li>
            </ol>
