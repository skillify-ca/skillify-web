## Introduction

Java is a popular language, which is used by around 6 million people around the world. Learning it may seem daunting at first, but establishing a good foundation and following this guide will help you succeed.

## Learning the Basics

While learning Java, you may see syntax that seems confusing or unfamiliar initially. Some of the introductory concepts in Java, such as user input through the scanner and the concept of classes will make much more sense as you move further through your journey.

Getting familiar with Java syntax is important, especially if you come from a different programming language. For beginners, try to understand all the programming fundamentals, including loops, primitives vs non-primitives and conditional statements. You can then move on to classes and objects, exception handling and inheritance, which are slightly more difficult concepts. Below, is a video with a suggested roadmap to master Java.

## Practice

Practice makes perfect and along with making your own projects, I believe problem-solving is a great way to wrap your head around Java thoroughly. You can start by doing a couple simple exercises to reinforce the core programming fundamentals. Learning data structures and algorithms can also help you tackle harder problem solving questions. Below is a great video to learn data structures and algorithms in Java.
