Like many aspiring software engineers, I turned to a coding academy as an alternative to traditional schooling to help develop my skills and establish connections in the industry. I can say from experience that it has been a rewarding journey, but also at times overwhelming, challenging and anxiety-inducing! With that in mind, I've curated 18 tips to help you in your coding academy or software engineering internship.

## Here are the tips:

1. **Don't get stuck in tutorial hell.** While tutorials are helpful, true learning comes from building your own projects and learning from your mistakes.

2. **Ask for help early and often.** Don't hesitate to seek assistance if you're struggling with a concept or need guidance on a project.

3. **Trust your own pace.** Embrace your individuality and focus on your progress instead of comparing yourself to others or conforming to expectations.

4. **Believe in yourself fully,** especially when the odds seem against you. Keep a positive mindset and remember that you only fail if you choose to give up.

5. **Be honest with yourself and others.** Admitting to yourself when you're struggling or feeling stuck is the first step to getting the support you need.

6. **Celebrate bite-sized progress.** Focus on making small improvements every day, and over time, they will add up to significant progress.

7. **Take care of yourself.** Prioritize self-care by taking breaks, exercising, eating well, and maintaining your mental health.

8. **Embrace success.** Regularly visualize what success looks like. Take some time, early in the day, and hold onto that feeling.

9. **Embrace failure.** Don't be afraid to try new things or take risks, even if they result in failure. Failure is a valuable learning experience.

10. **Stay organized.** Keep track of your assignments, deadlines, and notes in a way that works best for you, whether that be through a physical planner or a digital to-do list like Todoist.

11. **Read documentation thoroughly.** Understanding how to navigate documentation is an essential skill for software engineers, so take the time to read and comprehend documentation carefully.

12. **Follow the revision rule of 3's.** Reinforce your understanding of the new concept or material by reviewing it on three separate occasions.

13. **Practice consistently.** Dedicate time every day to coding, even if it's just for a few minutes, to keep your skills sharp and maintain momentum.

14. **Collaborate with others.** Working with classmates or colleagues on projects can help you learn from their strengths and weaknesses, while also building your teamwork skills.

15. **Practice intentional communicating.** Clear and effective communication is critical in any professional field, so don't be afraid to work on developing your communication skills through intentional practice and asking for feedback.

16. **Keep up with the latest industry news.** Use articles, podcasts, blogs, or social media to stay informed and relevant.

17. **Network actively.** Attend meetups or conferences, participate in online forums or groups, and connect with people in the industry to expand your professional network.

18. **Seek out mentorship.** Find someone with more experience than you to mentor you and provide guidance throughout your journey.
