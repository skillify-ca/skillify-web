              In this assignment you will need to set up your Blog to follow the
              French Flag Layout using CSS Grid. Check out my previous video
              called 'What is a div' for hints.
            </p>
            <p>The Layout below is what you want to aim for.</p>
            <img src="/images/coding/units/css/layout1.png" className="w-96" />
          </div>
          <div className="mb-12">
            <p className="text-charmander">Step 4:</p>
            <p>Use Flexbox to create a row of navigation links.</p>

          <div className="mb-12">
            <p className="text-charmander">Step 5:</p>
            <p>
              Once you have the layout in place, the sky is the limit. Try out
              different CSS styles to make your page cool and exciting! Add
              colours, hover effects, borders, or whatever you want!
            </p>

            <p className="text-charmander">Step 6:</p>
            <p>
              Create a second html page and style it with a similar design that
              you used to style your first html page. Put the second html page
              in the same folder as your primary home page that you built in the
              previous assignment. This second page should resemble some kind of
              online store that users would come to buy things online. You don't
              have to implement any purchasing functionality, but you should
              build the layout of an online store and connect this second page
              to your home page using an a tag in the navigation bar.
            </p>

          <div className="mb-12">
            <p className="text-charmander">Step 7:</p>
            <p>
              On your second page make sure to implement a different kind of
              advanced grid layout than what you used on your first page. Don't
              forget to link the two pages together!
