          Can you tell me a bit about your education and career background?
        </h4>
        <p className="text-black text-sm px-60">
          I studied Computer Science at Ontario Tech University (formerly known
          as the University of Ontario Institute of Technology). During my co-op
          in school, I explored many different jobs -- I was a developer, DevOps
          engineer, and then a performance tester, which is the career I had
          been doing for a while after graduating.
        </p>
        <h4 className="text-black text-sm font-semibold px-60">
          What motivated you to pivot your career towards coding?
        </h4>
        <p className="text-black text-sm px-60">
          Coding has always been my passion. I did coding for most of my
          computer science degree and a bit during my co-op as a developer. I
          wanted to get back into software development because development is
          all about coding. Although I had to leave my performance testing job
          to join Skillify, I thought it was worth the risk because it’s
          something I’m going to get back into as a passion.
        </p>
        <h4 className="text-black text-sm font-semibold px-60">
          What did you like most about Skillify's coding program?
        </h4>
        <p className="text-black text-sm px-60">
          The skills, experience, and personalized coaching. I also enjoyed the
          projects I was doing, which challenged me to apply both problem
          solving skills and creativity -- this was something Skillify taught me
          that I thought was really unique and useful.
        </p>
        <h4 className="text-black text-sm font-semibold px-60">
          What was your favourite project that you did?
        </h4>
        <p className="text-black text-sm px-60">
          There was a project called Tamil Record, which is essentially a
          directory for all kinds of Tamil businesses, and I personally liked
          working on it because not a lot of Tamil businesses get online
          advertisements.
        </p>
        <h4 className="text-black text-sm font-semibold px-60">
          What are the most valuable skills you learned? How have you
          incorporated these skills in your current job?
        </h4>
        <p className="text-black text-sm px-60">
          The creativity and problem solving skills are two of the most valuable
          skills I learned at Skillify and have transitioned into my current job
          as a software engineer, because most of the tasks I’m doing right now
          involve being able to think on my feet and solve things creatively.
        </p>
        <h4 className="text-black text-sm font-semibold px-60">
          What sets Skillify Coding Academy apart from universities/colleges?
        </h4>
        <p className="text-black text-sm px-60">
          The whole personalized touch is what sets Skillify apart from any
          other bootcamp or any other university. Some universities treat
          students as a number, but at Skillify, you get 1-on-1’s with the
          coaches and you feel like they actually care for you and want you to
          succeed.
        </p>
        <h4 className="text-black text-sm font-semibold px-60">
          How are you liking your current job after pivoting careers?
        </h4>
        <p className="text-black text-sm px-60">
          My previous career as a performance tester was just okay, but the
          career I’m in right now has turned into a passion that I love. There’s
          this one saying, “If you turn your work into a passion, then it’s just
          fun at the end of the day.” Now my work days are just me coming in and
          doing fun things because I enjoy it. Sure, the money’s a bonus but the
          fact that I’m able to enjoy my job is like a cherry on top.
        </p>
        <h4 className="text-black text-sm font-semibold px-60">
          Why do you think so many people are intimidated by learning to code?
          What advice would you give to them?
        </h4>
        <p className="text-black text-sm px-60">
          Learning to code is like learning a new language. I think the whole
          aspect of being able to understand a language deep in and out, and
          then figuring out the best way to communicate something is
          intimidating, but I would say go for it. If it’s going to help you get
          something like a job or benefit you at the end of the day, then why
          not try it? I took that risk switching careers because I wanted to
          turn my passion for coding into something I could do for the rest of
          my life.
        </p>
        <h4 className="text-black text-sm font-semibold px-60">
          Do you have any advice for people considering a career in tech?
        </h4>
        <p className="text-black text-sm px-60">
          Go for it. The tech industry is booming, and there’s a lot of startups
          and mid-size companies looking to hire people right now. I know
          there’s been news that some larger companies are laying off people,
          but I think that’s going to help a lot of the smaller companies grow.
          Even though you’re going to be competing with a bunch of other people,
          there’s a lot more opportunities than there are people in the tech
          sector. If you’re considering a career in tech and you feel like it’s
          your passion or you can get a lot out of it, then you should do it.
