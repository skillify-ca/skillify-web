          Can you tell me a bit about your education and career background?
        </h4>
        <p className="text-black text-sm px-60">
          I studied Mechanical Engineering at York University. Throughout my
          undergrad, I had a few different internships in robotics, mechanical
          engineering, and entrepreneurship.
        </p>
        <h4 className="text-black text-sm font-semibold px-60">
          What motivated you to learn coding?
        </h4>
        <p className="text-black text-sm px-60">
          I already had some low level hardware programming skills from my
          degree and work experience, but I was motivated to join Skillify
          Coding Academy to learn more modern frameworks and switch from
          mechanical to software engineering.
        </p>
        <h4 className="text-black text-sm font-semibold px-60">
          What did you like most about Skillify's coding program?
        </h4>
        <p className="text-black text-sm px-60">
          The mentorship I received from coaches helped me build confidence as a
          software engineer. Skillify’s coaches have decades of experience in
          the tech industry, so you know you can trust their guidance and
          advice.
        </p>
        <h4 className="text-black text-sm font-semibold px-60">
          What are the most valuable skills you learned? How have you
          incorporated these skills in your current job?
        </h4>
        <p className="text-black text-sm px-60">
          The most valuable skill I learned was how to build products quickly
          and iterate afterwards. A key strategy I use in my current job is
          releasing minimum viable products (MVP) and optimizing them later on.
        </p>
        <h4 className="text-black text-sm font-semibold px-60">
          What sets Skillify Coding Academy apart from universities/colleges?
        </h4>
        <p className="text-black text-sm px-60">
          The personalized mentorship is something you don’t typically get from
          universities/colleges, and the real world projects you get to work on
          and build are unique to Skillify.
        </p>
        <h4 className="text-black text-sm font-semibold px-60">
          Why do you think so many people are intimidated by learning to code?
          What advice would you give to them?
        </h4>
        <p className="text-black text-sm px-60">
          Coding looks like a foreign language to people with no experience or
          knowledge of it. It’s kind of similar to math in the sense that it’s a
          language everyone can learn and understand.
        </p>
        <h4 className="text-black text-sm font-semibold px-60">
          Do you have any advice for people considering a career in tech?
        </h4>
        <p className="text-black text-sm px-60">
          You should work on projects that you’re genuinely interested in --
          this is the best way to stay motivated!
