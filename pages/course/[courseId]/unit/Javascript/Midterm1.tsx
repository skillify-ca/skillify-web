            <p>
              In the previous modules, you were introduced to the concept of
              iterators, which include, .map and .filter. These iterators are
              actually used in a profesional setting all the time! That means,
              you must be confortable with using .map and .filter in order to
              apply them in your future job opprotunities. In this assignment,
              you will work with big JSON objects and apply iterators to narrow
              down to specific data.

              First and foremost, you must download the Javascript Assignment
              file. You can find this towards the bottom right side of the page.
              Click the "Download" and it should download a .zip file.

              {" "}
              Secondly you must have Node.js installed and the Code Runner
              Extension.{" "}

              <b>Objective:</b> Write a javascript function that takes this NBA
              Box Score JSON and returns the pid of the player who scored the
              most points in that game.

              <li>
                You are handed a very large JSON object containing a lot of
                data. However, the main properties we are looking for in this
                JSON object is "pd". This is the array of the 4 periods in the
                Basketball game.
              </li>
              <li>
                Within this "pd" array, we can see that the first index of the
                array in this case index 0, is all the plays that happen in
                period 1.
              </li>
              <li>
                Note that plays is found in the "pla" array. There are many
                different types of plays in Basketball. Anything from scoring a
                bucket, jump-off, misses, are all considered plays. The way we
                differentiate between different plays is by using the "etype"
                property. Since we are only concerned about the scored buckets,
                we will only consider the plays with the etype of 15.
              </li>
              <li>
                We must now figure out a way to fiter only the plays of etype of
                15.
              </li>

              <li>
                Now we must keep track of which pid scored how many points and
                return the pid that scored the most.
