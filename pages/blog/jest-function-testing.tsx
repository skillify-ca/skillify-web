          Sometimes end-to-end testing with a tool like Cypress is necessary to
          ensure your UI features work as expected. But this type of testing can
          be costly in terms of processing power and runtime. Is there another
          way to test business critical UI without end-to-end-tests?
          Fortunately, there is. A creative approach to ensuring your
          Tailwind/CSS styles display as intended is to use a few simple and
          inexpensive unit tests. This method of testing can save both time and
          resources, while still ensuring the UI remains functional and
          up-to-date.

        <p>
          At Skillify, we believe in providing our students with all the support
          they need to reach their goals. As part of our coaching program,
          students are required to set regular goals, which are then shared with
          instructors to help with tracking progress. To ensure the code is
          well-protected, we shipped the goals feature with the help of jest +
          Function testing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here’s how we did it at Skillify: first, I created a series of tests
          to ensure the UI was working as expected. This included verifying user
          input fields, making sure data was being stored correctly and that any
          changes made to the code didn't alter the intended UI. We then ran the
          tests and checked the output of our function to make sure everything
          was working as expected.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is how the goals feature appears for instructors and students
          after they navigate to the goals section on the student web portal.
        </p>
        <div className="flex items-center">
          <img
            src={"/images/blog/jest-function-testing/goalTesting.png"}
            className="w-full "
          />
        </div>
        <p>
          Here students can set “Goals” and choose the “Target Dates” by which
          they intend to finish them. The “Days Remaining” column takes the
          “Target Date” column and subtracts the current date, giving the user a
          quick visual of the number of days they have left to complete the goal
          by the target date. Sweet and simple! Goals can also be archived or
          completed by the user. And to enhance user experience – goal tracking
          at a glance, as I like to call it – is the UI{" "}
          <span className="bg-red-500">red</span>-
          <span className="bg-yellow-500">yellow</span>-clear highlighting
          feature I am testing with jest. Only current goals are intended to be
          included in this highlighting; and goals with less than 0 days
          remaining should be <span className="bg-red-500">RED</span>, goals
          with 1-3 days remaining <span className="bg-yellow-500">YELLOW</span>,
          and goals with +3 days remaining NOT HIGHLIGHTED.
        </p>
        <p>
          This highlighting functionality was business critical and it was
          important to create tests to protect this feature from ever breaking
          in production.
        </p>
        <p>
          I query a list of user goals from our GraphQL API and pass each goal
          in the list through a function called returnGoalStyle. Goals have
          various properties like Title, Date Added, and Target Completion Date.
          The Target Completion Date property controls the conditional
          highlighting for each goal with Tailwind classes.
        </p>
        <p>
          How can I test that the correct color is used for a specific goal? How
          can I validate this behavior in fast-to-run unit tests, vs slower
          end-to-end tests?
        </p>
        <p>
          Since a goal that is due in 3 days should be highlighted in yellow, I
          created a string variable that represented the tailwind classes for a
          yellow background.
        </p>
        <p>
          More specifically, I wrote tests that ensure that the styles of the
          goals contained the Tailwind class `bg-yellow-300`. Checking for the
          existence of a string inside a unit test is so much faster than having
          to spin up an entire end-to-end test to verify that a
          {JSON.stringify("<div>")} element has a yellow background.
        </p>
        <p>
          The full returnGoalStyle function I attached in the End Notes for
          additional context and your full viewing pleasure!
        </p>
        <h2 className="text-3xl font-thin">So let’s do some jesting!</h2>
        <p>
          To set up a jest test all I’m required to do is define a “Goal” object
          and pass it into my returnGoalStyle function. Now I just have to
          assert that the returned style (which is just a string) matches
          against what I expect. Here’s an example of what a sample Goal object
          might look like.
        </p>
        <CodeBlock>
          {`    isComplete: false,
    targetDate: new Date("2022-12-1"),
    isArchived: null,`}
        </CodeBlock>
        <p>
          Next, to make my jesting experience readable to other jester coders, I
          define the Tailwind class I expect to get as follows:
        </p>
        <CodeBlock>
          {`const yellowHighlightStyle = "text-black-500 bg-yellow-300 rounded-xl p-2";`}
        </CodeBlock>
        <p>
          Next, I define the “result” I expect my function to return when I
          input the “Goal” object I have defined.
        </p>
        <CodeBlock>{`const result = returnGoalStyle(goal);`}</CodeBlock>
        <p>
          Finally, this magic little line runs my test! It matches my “result”,
          what the function actually gives me, to the UI tailwind classes I am
          expecting to get, “yellowHighlightStyle” if the feature is working
          properly.
        </p>
        <CodeBlock>{` expect(result).toBe(yellowHighlightStyle);`}</CodeBlock>
        <p>Note: The End Notes contain one full jest test for more context.</p>
        <p>
          Upon running the test with the command “npm run test”, my gaze fals
          upon the lines every jest-er wants to see…
        </p>
        <div className="flex items-center">
          <img
            src={"/images/blog/jest-function-testing/testsPassed.png"}
            className="w-full"
          />
        </div>
        <p>
          UI/Tailwind class testing on goals feature – check! It’s really that
          simple. I jest you not.
        </p>
        Can I also draw your attention to the yellow text above… the fact that I
        was able to test the UI on this feature and run a number of additional
        tests in my test suite, along with 7 other unrelated test suites, and
        the whole parade of tests finish their marching orders in only 13.296
        seconds, and my entire test suite took me a number of minutes to write.
        It’s also much easier for me to reason about my code because I’m just
        checking for the existence of strings. At the least, that’s a win for me
        as a rather cheap additional line of defense protecting my customers’
        experience and the brand of my employer.

        <ol>
          <li>
            <span className="font-bold">
              Before you begin: Pull the Tailwind/CSS class code that controls
              the UI functionality out of your component
            </span>
            , as I already did in the example above, and place it into a
            separate function. Make sure this function controls the critical UI
            functionality you want to test and feel may be subject to change as
            the feature evolves. Pulling Tailwind/CSS classes out of a div and
            putting them into a separate function can also be helpful because it
            makes your component code cleaner and more concise. If the function
            is reusable throughout your code base, it is best to save it in a
            separate file in an API folder and import it into your component.

            That’s a judgment call. However, you should ensure edge cases and
            all the most critical elements of functionality are covered.

          If you’re looking for an efficient way to test complex user interfaces
          and ensure the best customer experience, consider using a jest unit
          test. It’s a powerful tool that can save you time and effort, and
          provide an additional layer of protection for your customers.
