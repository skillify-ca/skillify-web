    title: "Back-End Project",
    goal: "The goal of this project is to create a RESTful API using a back-end technology of your choice. The API should handle CRUD operations for a specific resource (e.g., users, products, posts)",
    objectives: ["Create a RESTful API with endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting the specified resource", "Implement proper error handling and validation for API requests", "Use a database (SQL or NoSQL) to store and retrieve data for the resource", "Secure the API endpoints using authentication and authorization mechanisms (optional, but recommended)", "Document the API endpoints using a tool like Swagger or Postman", "Optimize the API performance for efficient data retrieval and response times", "Handle edge cases and potential security vulnerabilities"],
    requirements: ["Strong understanding of back-end technologies (e.g., Node.js, Python, Ruby on Rails, Django, Express, etc.)", "Familiarity with RESTful API design principles and best practices", "Experience in working with databases and data modeling", "Knowledge of authentication and authorization mechanisms (JWT, OAuth, etc.) for securing APIs (optional but recommended)", "Thoroughly document your API endpoints for ease of understanding and testing" ],
    estimatedTime: "Follow the objectives and requirements mentioned below to complete the project within 1-2 weeks",
    submissionRequirements: "To submit your assignment, you will need to create a GitHub repository for your API project and share the link with us. Please ensure that your repository includes all the necessary code, database configuration, and clear instructions for running and testing your API locally.",
