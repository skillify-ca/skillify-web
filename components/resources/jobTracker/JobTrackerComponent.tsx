        One of our coaches recently spent a few months interviewing with various
        tech companies from January to March of 2023. Here is a list of outcomes
        from the interviews.
      </p>
      <ul className="p-4 list-disc list-inside">
        <li>
          Our coach has 10 years of experience in the field working on various
          tech stacks
        </li>
        <li>Many roles were remote friendly</li>
        <li>
          Roles that required relocation to an SF or NYC office were
          considerably higher than remote roles
        </li>
        <li>
          Android roles were easier to get compared to frontend or fullstack
          roles. The market is competitive for JavaScript developers.
        </li>
        <li>
          Some companies offered additional stock equity bonuses as part of
          total compensation but this is harder to value given that you can not
          easily sell your stock. The value of the stock depends on the value of
          the company which is hard to predict.
        </li>

        <li>
          Lots of roles got cancelled after starting the interview process. This
          could mean many companies are actively trying to pull back and slow
          down hiring.
        </li>
        <li>
          The best tool for applying online by far was using{" "}

          </a>
        </li>
        <li>
          Many companies pay based on geographic location of the employee even
          if the work is remote. The Canadian market is lower than the US market
          so a candidate applying to the same roles from the US could earn a
          higher salary.
