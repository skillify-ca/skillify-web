      <p className="">
        Over the years our students and coaches spent time interviewing with
        various tech companies for senior developer roles. Here is a list of
        outcomes from past interviews.
      </p>
      <h3 className="mt-4 text-xl font-bold">Recommendations</h3>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
        <li>
          Find a niche eg. Mobile, AI, Blockchain, or Game Dev. There are so
          many JavaScript developers and the market is competitive.
        </li>
        <li>
          When applying to jobs online, the best tool to use by far was{" "}
          <a className="text-blue-800 underline" href="www.otta.com">
            Otta
          </a>{" "}
          compared to applying on LinkedIn or Google
        </li>
        <li>
          Prioritize reaching out to your network to get referrals. That was the
          easiest way to get interviews.
        </li>
        <li>
          In order to maximize your salary, look for remote jobs in US cities.
          Note that there are some disadvantages to remote work and there is
          value in going into an office regularly with people and working on
          projects together in person with your team.
        </li>
        <li>
          Don't spend all your time on Leetcode. Many companies are moving away
          from that style of interviewing in favour of live project
          building/debugging.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3 className="mt-4 text-xl font-bold">Observations</h3>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
        <li>
          The job market is heavily skewed towards senior level developer roles.
        </li>
        <li>
          A large number of companies are remote friendly and let you work from
          anywhere in the world. These companies save money on office space and
          also get to hire good people regardless of where they live.
        </li>
        <li>
          A select number of remote companies provide location agnostic pay.
          These companies hire the best people from anywhere in the world and
          offer a Bay Area salary to all employees.
        </li>
        <li>
          Most companies offer a salary that is dependent on where you live.
          These companies look at the supply and demand for developers in your
          local area and pay you accordingly.
        </li>
        <li>
          Android roles were easier to get compared to frontend or fullstack
          roles. The market is competitive for JavaScript developers.
        </li>
        <li>
          Some companies offered additional stock equity bonuses as part of
          total compensation but this is harder to value given that you can not
          easily sell your stock. The value of the stock depends on the value of
          the company which is hard to predict.
        </li>

        <li>
          Lots of roles got cancelled after starting the interview process. This
          was frustrating as a job seeker, but this could mean many companies
          are actively trying to pull back and slow down hiring.
        </li>

        <li>
          Many companies pay based on geographic location of the employee even
          if the work is remote. The Canadian market is lower than the US market
          so a candidate applying to the same roles from the US could earn a
          higher salary.
