          <b>Strengths ðŸ’ª</b>
          <br />
          You have a strong foundation in HTML and CSS, with high confidence
          across skills like using flexbox, CSS grid, images, text formatting,
          etc. Your React skills are also coming along nicely - you have
          experience with interactivity, conditional rendering, lists/arrays,
          and state management. The high ratings in these areas show you have
          put in meaningful practice and have retained what you've learned.
          <br />
          <br />
          <b>Areas for growth ðŸ“ˆ</b>
          <br />
          While your core web dev skills are progressing well, you have
          opportunities to expand into backend development and tools like SQL,
          AWS, and API integrations that will make you a more well-rounded
          engineer. Identifying those gaps and starting to level up through
          tutorials, courses, and projects would be great next steps. There also
          seem to be openings around JavaScript data structures, objects,
          maps/filters that are essential. Practicing those patterns will likely
          have a big impact.

          <br />
          Finally, continuing to build 3+ portfolio projects to showcase what
          you can build is key.

          <b>Questions for you ðŸ¤”</b>
          <br />
          <br />
          What parts of coding so far have been the most fun or interesting to
          you? What would you be excited to build next? As you think about
          leveling up your skills, what's one new area you'd be most excited to
          learn about in the next 3 months? How can I best support your learning
          and growth goals in the months ahead?
          <br />
