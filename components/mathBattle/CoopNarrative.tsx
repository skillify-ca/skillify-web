            A Scientist by the name of Franklin was conducting a terrifying
            experiment in science history. He created his own chemical called

            mind-controllling screams, and tremedous height.{" "}

            Franklin believed that he could use Franksteinium to save the world
            from evil. He believed if he drank this potion he could be the hero
            of the century. But one thing Franklin missed on his calulation was
            that the potion was radioactive.{" "}

            Unknowingly, Franklin still drank the potion and the side effects
            were unexpected. His skin turned green, his head became enormous,
            and worst of all, he lost his ability to think logically. He became
            a monster! This monster started stealing candy from kids. Door by
            door, with fear in the families eyes. Franklin has now became
            Frankinstein.{" "}
