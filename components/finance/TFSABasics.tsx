            The government created the Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) because
            they wanted to encourage more Canadians to invest their money. If
            you invest your money in a normal account and made money, then the
            federal government has the right tax you on any gains or profits
            that you made. If you invest that same money in a TFSA then you're
            allowed to keep all the gains you make off of your investment and
            you don't have to give the government any of your profit.

              Don't over contribute more than the limit. If you go over the
              government will charge you a penalty for doing that.
            </li>
            <li>
              You're allowed to take money out of your TFSA accounts at any
              time, but when you take money out your limit doesn't increase. It
              stays the same until the next calendar year. This means that if
              you deposit $1k into a TFSA, take it out and put it back in, then
              you've used $2k of your annual limit. As far as the government is
              concerned, you made two $1K contributions to your TFSA in the same
              calendar year. In the next calendar year on January 1, you will
              carry over any unused contribution room to the current calendar
              year and get that $1K back in contribution room.
