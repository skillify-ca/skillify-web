            Hey, it's Mr.Brainy at your service!
            <p> There are different methods to solving addition problem</p>
            <p className="font-bold text-yellow-700">
              Method 1: Counting with our fingers
            </p>
            Okay so let's start of with counting with our fingers since these
            are small numbers. For 5 + 3 let's start with 5 fingers up. If we
            put one finger up we get ... 6. If we put two fingers up we get ...
            7. And if we put three fingers up... TADA! We get 8!
            <br></br>
            But there still is another way!
            <br></br>
            <p className="font-bold text-purple-700">Method 2: Number Line</p>
            We can also use a number line to find the sum. We start from 5 on
            the number line and move three places to the right to land on 8.
            This is the sum.
